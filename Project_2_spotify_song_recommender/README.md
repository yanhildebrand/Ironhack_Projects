#### Spotify Song Recommender

After cloning the repo, running Project2_2023.07.05_Spotify_Recommender_App_Oneliner.ipynb in jupyter notebook will run the app with default presets.

The K-Means clustering model can be built from scratch following these notebooks:
1. Project2_2023.07.05_Loading_Playlists.ipynb
2. Project2_2023.07.05_KMeans_Model_Evaluation.ipynb
3. Project2_2023.07.05_Spotify_Recommender_App.ipynb

The main factor determining the accuracy of the clustering model, is the amount of data that is used to build it. Due to limitations of the Spotify API, only a limited amount of data could be accessed. The song recommender may therefore not alwayd provide satisfactory results.
